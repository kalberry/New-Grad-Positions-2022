General Physician, PC

Web Developer

- Designed, coded, and improved existing website to be more user-friendly and take into account extra accessibility features for the audience utilizing the website

I believe my greatest strength is problem solving, and that is, in my opinion, the heart of being a software developer. I also:
- Have the school knowledge by going to a school with a somewhat challenging curriculum and achieving a 3.65 GPA
- Have the work knowledge by being brought on as a software development intern not once, but 4 separate times. I consistently proved my worth to the company I am with and they saw that
- Have the side project experience by building (and partially completing) a full-stack web application(flask/react/postgres) that has CICD pipelines with GitLab to deploy to the world using Heroku

There has been almost nothing that I couldn't solve by copious amounts of research and understanding of the underlying reasons of WHY it works the way it does. I think asking the question of WHY has given me so much knowledge of not only software development, but computer science as a whole.

I am a highly motivated, honest worker who is not afraid to ask questions. I pride myself on not only getting the job done, but following clean coding principals, following aspects of test driven development, and truly believing in documentation as a strength for not only on-boarding, but existing members of the project as well.
